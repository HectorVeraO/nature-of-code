# Nature of code

This repository contains the notes I've taken and code samples written
while reading the book [Nature of Code]([https://](https://natureofcode.com/))
by Daniel Shiffman.


## TODO
- Play around with p5.js, see its
  [getting started](https://p5js.org/get-started) and
  [documentation](https://p5js.org/)
- [Left here](https://natureofcode.com/introduction/#how-are-you-reading-this-book)
